# Climate Data Dashboard
This web application allows users to load, modify, and download climate data from JSON files. It provides a convenient way for users to interact with and visualize climate data, with functionality tailored to educational use.

## Features
- Load Climate Data: Users can upload their own JSON files containing climate data. A template for New York City is available for download at the start.

- Data Management: Users can edit, delete, and add entries to their datasets. Changes can be saved and downloaded as new JSON files.

- Table and Chart Creation: The app generates a table and a climate chart based on the uploaded data.

- Download Options: Users can download either the table or the chart. The chart can be downloaded in three different resolutions (low, medium, and high).

- Language: The app is designed in German, as it is intended to enrich geography lessons at my school, which is conducted in German.
